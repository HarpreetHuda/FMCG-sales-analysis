FMCG sales analysis in Excel Pivot Table

FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) sales analysis is the process of analyzing the sales data of consumer goods that are sold quickly, such as food, beverages, toiletries, and other household items. This analysis is used to identify trends in consumer buying behavior, track sales performance, and make data-driven decisions about product development, marketing, and pricing. Sales data is typically collected from point-of-sale systems, market research, and other sources, and is analyzed using statistical techniques such as trend analysis, forecasting, and market segmentation. The goal of FMCG sales analysis is to provide insights that can help companies improve their product offerings and increase their market share.
